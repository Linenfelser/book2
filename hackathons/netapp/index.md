# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?
	Dont know what the useable data is

## Why is the problem important?
	With the useable data, they can determine the most cost effective solution (the correct amount of writes per day)

## What dataset has been made available?


## What specific questions are being raised?


# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## How was the system expected to report back the data? (every day at certain time?)
	every day it was supposed to send you the information, and then reset. Should be reporting at the same time every day

## What format is the "time of day data" in? Is it useable to determine
	There is a delta calculated from teh base time and observation time. 

## Where are the times coming from and are they standardized?


# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?
	As a csv file?


## How should the work be distributed among the team members?
	Divide up quetions equally, or split into groups to tackel the bigger issues


## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?
	bar charts, graphs over time, pie charts 


## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
	Questions that require many different serial numbers may be hard to visualize
	When each display has its own section in tableau there will be way too many visulizations
